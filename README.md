# ðŸ”’ Keycloak 2FA Email Authenticator

Keycloak Authentication Provider implementation to get a two factor authentication with an OTP (One-time-password) send via Email (through SMTP).

When logging in with this provider, you can send a verification code (OTP) to the user's e-mail address.
Tested with Keycloak version 26.x. If you are using a different Keycloak version, don't forget to change the version in pom.xml file.

The [Server Development part of the Keycloak reference documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/index.html) contains additional resources and examples for developing custom Keycloak extensions.

# Development

If you are using Eclipse, you need to install the Lombok plugin, otherwise Eclipse cannot resolve `log` which is declared at runtim through @JBossLog annotation.
